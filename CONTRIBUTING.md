## <a name="reporting-an-issue"></a> Reporting an Issue

If you believe you've encountered a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please take the following steps:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, check our existing issues to see if your concern has already been reported. Don’t forget to look at closed issues, as they may contain solutions or relevant discussions.
   
2. **Create a New Issue**: If your bug or feature idea hasn’t been reported yet, please create a new issue. If you’re proposing a new feature, include a detailed description of your proposal so that we can assess its feasibility and potential implementation.

To ensure a smooth integration of your code changes, please follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue First**: Before submitting a pull request (PR), create an issue that outlines the bug or feature request. This allows us to understand the context of your changes.
   
2. **Comment on Existing Issues**: If the issue already exists, please comment on it to indicate your intention to submit a pull request. This helps us track contributions and prevents duplicated efforts.

3. **Submit Your Pull Request**: Once you have addressed the issue, feel free to submit your pull request with a clear description of the changes you’ve made.
